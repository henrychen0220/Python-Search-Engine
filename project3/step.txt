1. read bookkeeping.json
2. for each pair in the json file, get the folder number, 
file number, and url name
3. parse each pair and tokenize the word in each document
4. for each word, then generate 

frequency of occurrence for word in each document
inverse document frequency for each word
tf-idf weighting (Wt,d=[1+ log(tft,d)] x log(N/dft))

5. query

normalize by dividing by the length
sorted by cosine similarity

5. build inverted index based on the information above
6. store inverted index into a new json file (mongoDB), token will
be the key and the posting list is the value

7. we can use mongoDB to store and retrieve json files
